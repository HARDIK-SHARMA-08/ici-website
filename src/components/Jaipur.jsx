            The Pink City, Jaipur is considered as the first "planned" city in
            the Common Era. Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital
            city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history of
            marvellous forts, magnificent temples and gorgeous palaces with all
            the advantages of a metropolis. Jaipur is a popular tourist
            destination in India and forms a part of the west Golden Triangle
            tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra (240 km, 149 mi). It also
            serves as a gateway to other tourist destinations in Rajasthan such
            as
            <ul>
            <li>Delhi and Agra (240 km, 149 mi)</li>
